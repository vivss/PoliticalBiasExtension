# WiCHacks Project

Given the current political climate, we wanted to get a better understanding of how our media sites reflect and influence our views. A recent article by Vox talks about ways to understand and and communicate with people with opposing views by understanding their values. Through our project, we hope to make people aware of their biases, bridge the disconnect between the left and right, and spur more meaningful conversation.

# What it Does
Draws from a data set of about 800 websites labeled as left, left-center, center, right-center, and right. These websites are then matched against the websites you've visited. We display your top 10 news sites and color code them based on the tagged leaning. It also checks what site you're on right now and suggests a contrasting media site.
